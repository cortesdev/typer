typer is an Angular directive that simulates someone typing and deleting over a list of words. The directive is highly customisable and allows the words to be set by passing an array of strings as an attribute, the transition times can also be set on the directive. [see below](#options) for a full list of customisations.

 If you have any suggestions for additional features or find any bugs please log them [here](/issues).

# Documentation

include the typer directive source file in your html


```
 <script src="path/to/typer.js"></script>

```

Mark the typer module as a dependecy of your angular app

```
angular.module('myApp', ['typer']);

```

Then declare the typer directive in your markup

```
<typer words="['JavaScript', 'Angular', 'Cats']" type-time='150' backspace-time='200' start-delay='1500' highlight-background='#2980b9'></typer>

```

**Note:** The directive will inherit the styles of its parent element so it is recommmend to nest it like below


```
 <h1 class="main-title">I love <typer words="['JavaScript', 'Angular', 'Cats']" type-time='150' backspace-time='200' start-delay='1500' highlight-background='#2980b9'></typer></h1>

```
